## Overview

Our app empowers businesses to automate the order confirmation process for COD orders. As soon as an order is placed, our system automatically sends an SMS or WhatsApp message to the customer's registered contact number to confirm the order details, payment method, and expected delivery date

Businesses can personalize and customize the content of the SMS and WhatsApp messages sent to customers. This flexibility ensures that messaging matches the brand's tone and style, enhancing the overall customer experience and brand perception.

The app generates comprehensive reports and analytics to help businesses gain insights into their COD order process. This data assists in identifying areas for improvement, optimizing operations, and enhancing the efficiency of cash-on-delivery operations.
